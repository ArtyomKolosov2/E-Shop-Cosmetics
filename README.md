Hello there!
This is our first big project that we've created together with [@Kuzmich](https://github.com/kuzmiich)
***
Our site has all the main features of E-SHOP.
Modern and usefull user interface helps easily navigate the site.
***
The site includes role system.
Users can be separated into 3 roles: user, admin, developer.

The user can view products, search for them, as well as add the necessary products to the cart and then make an order

The administrator can add products, change products and delete products. The administrator also can view orders made by other users and change them.

Developer role grants access to API of our E-SHOP
